      <p class="">The temple was built in 1196 CE by Amrutheshwara Dandanayaka (commander) under the Hoysala King Veera Ballala II. He also set up a Brahminpuri of 24 Brahmin families around the temple for looking after the affairs of the temple.The temple is located in a quiet spot close to the reservoir of the Bhadra River. This 12th century structure was built following the many hallmark features of Hoysala architecture. Many experts describe this temple as part of the older Hoysala style of architecture.</p>

      <p>The rows of shining lathe turned pillars that support the ceiling of the mantapa is a Hoysala-Chalukya decorative idiom.[9] The mantapa has many deeply domed inner ceiling structures adorned with floral designs. The outer parapet wall of the open mantapa has a total of hundred and forty panel sculptures with depictions from the Hindu epics. Unlike many Hoysala temples where the panels are small and carvings in miniature, these panels are comparatively larger. The Ramayana is sculpted on the south side wall on seventy panels, with the story proceeding quite unusually, in anti-clockwise direction. On the north side wall, all depictions are clockwise, a norm in Hoysala architectural articulation. Twenty five panels depict the life of the Hindu god Krishna and the remaining forty five panels depict scenes from the epic Mahabharata</p>
